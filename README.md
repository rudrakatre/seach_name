1. In this project, I am considering that only file will be available with the name large.csv.
2. If the required name can be provided using environment variable as FILE_NAME
3. Here I am providing the search details only for the words consist of the search keyword (at the start and in between of the words based on the words length).
4. Also added one more file named service_all.py, where all possible words have been searched, for example, search keyword is Shyam, then search will be having all words containing "Shyam", "Shya", "Shy".
5. Also in jquery I have kept two option one is keyup event and other is click event, right now keyup is commented since it was searching for all the options based on the change of the text which is not a cost-effective option.
